# Expert AI Search: Reverse Engineering AI Code Generation Platforms

## Master Prompt: The Hidden Architecture Behind AI Coding Assistants

I need to reverse-engineer exactly how Lovable, v0, Bolt, Cursor, Augment, and Windsurf built their AI architectures. Not the marketing fluff - I want the actual technical implementation details that let them generate, execute, and debug code autonomously.

**Deep Technical Investigation Required:**

### 1. The AI Layer Secret Sauce
- **Model Orchestration**: How exactly do they chain multiple LLMs? Is Cursor really using a custom router to switch between models mid-generation? What's the decision tree?
- **Prompt Engineering**: Find the ACTUAL system prompts. Not the leaked ones from 6 months ago - the current ones. How do they structure multi-thousand line prompts without hitting context limits?
- **Context Management**: How does Lovable maintain context across 50+ messages? Is it semantic chunking, vector embeddings, or something else? What's the exact implementation?
- **Custom Models**: Cursor claims they fine-tuned Llama-3-70b to match Claude Opus. HOW? What dataset? What training infrastructure? Can I replicate this?

### 2. Code Execution Architecture
- **Sandboxing Methods**: 
  - How does Bolt give AI control over filesystem without security risks?
  - What's v0's trick for running React components safely?
  - Is Lovable really spinning up Firecracker microVMs per user? What's the cost?
- **WebContainers Deep Dive**: Beyond the marketing - what are the actual limitations? How much RAM per container? CPU limits? Network restrictions?
- **Alternative Approaches**: Are there competitors to WebContainers? What about Sandpack, CodeSandbox's Pitcher, or Stackblitz's new projects?

### 3. The RAG Problem Nobody Talks About
- **Codebase Understanding**: Cursor uses Qdrant + tree-sitter. But what's the ACTUAL implementation? Chunk size? Overlap? Embedding model?
- **Real-time Indexing**: How do they index code changes in <1 second? Is it incremental parsing? Differential updates?
- **Semantic Search**: Beyond embeddings - how do they handle variable renaming, refactoring, and code evolution?

### 4. Infrastructure & Scale Secrets
- **The GPU Problem**: 
  - Augment/Cursor need massive GPU farms. Who's their provider? Azure? Lambda Labs? 
  - How do they handle inference at scale? Model parallelism? Tensor parallelism?
  - What's the actual cost per code completion?
- **Caching Strategy**: These platforms are FAST. What are they caching? KV caching? Prompt caching? Generated code caching?
- **Edge Computing**: Is anyone running models at edge? Using Cloudflare Workers AI? What's the latency trade-off?

### 5. The Money Trail (Follow the Infrastructure)
- **Windsurf's Architecture**: They claim to be different from Cursor. What's their actual technical differentiation?
- **Augment's $252M Secret**: What did they build that justified that valuation? Is it really just RAG + good UX?
- **Cost Structure**: 
  - What's the unit economics? 
  - How much does each code generation actually cost?
  - Why can Cursor afford unlimited Claude usage at $20/month?

### 6. Reverse Engineering Checklist
Find me:
- **Network traffic analysis**: What APIs are they calling? Request/response structures?
- **Browser DevTools secrets**: What's in localStorage? IndexedDB? WebSocket messages?
- **GitHub commits**: Early commits often reveal architecture decisions
- **Job postings**: What technologies are they hiring for? Rust engineers = performance focus
- **Patent filings**: What unique implementations have they patented?
- **Conference talks**: Did any engineers accidentally reveal implementation details?

### 7. The Smoking Guns
- **Error messages**: Stack traces often reveal internal architecture
- **Performance characteristics**: Response time patterns indicate caching/routing strategies  
- **Feature rollout patterns**: How do they A/B test? Feature flags reveal architecture
- **Support documentation**: Often contains technical details they don't mean to share
- **API documentation**: Even internal API structures can leak through browser tools

### 8. Competitive Intelligence
- **Who's poaching whose engineers?** (LinkedIn moves reveal technical priorities)
- **What open-source projects do their engineers contribute to?**
- **Which Discord servers/forums do their engineers frequent?**
- **What technical blog posts have they published then deleted?**

### 9. The Implementation Questions
- How do they handle:
  - **Streaming responses** with code execution?
  - **Multi-file edits** atomically?
  - **Rollback/undo** with AI-generated changes?
  - **Merge conflicts** between AI and human edits?
  - **Testing AI-generated code** automatically?
  - **Billing/usage tracking** at scale?

### 10. The Next Generation
- **What's coming in 2025?** 
  - Computer use APIs (like Anthropic's)?
  - Native IDE protocols beyond LSP?
  - WebGPU for local model inference?
  - WASM-based language servers?

**I need:**
1. Actual code snippets and implementation examples
2. Architecture diagrams (even hand-drawn ones from conferences)
3. Specific version numbers, commit hashes, and package dependencies
4. Names of key engineers and their previous projects
5. Undocumented APIs and internal endpoints
6. Performance benchmarks and bottlenecks
7. Security vulnerabilities they've patched (reveals architecture)

**Search everywhere:**
- HuggingFace discussions
- GitHub issues and PRs
- Twitter/X engineering threads  
- Reddit (r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning)
- Discord servers (TheBloke, LocalLLaMA, etc.)
- LinkedIn posts from employees
- Wayback Machine for deleted content
- Chinese forums (often have technical details)
- Russian programming forums
- Academic papers citing these tools

**The Ultimate Goal:**
I want to build something BETTER than all of them combined. But first, I need to understand EXACTLY how they built what they have. Not the marketing story - the real engineering decisions, trade-offs, and clever hacks that make them work.

Give me the information that would let a skilled engineer replicate (and improve upon) these platforms.
