# Expert AI Search Prompt for Educational AI Platform Research

## Primary Research Prompt

I'm building the next billion-dollar EdTech startup - an AI-powered platform that generates interactive educational playgrounds (like Seeing-Theory) for ANY subject. Students can type "teach me photosynthesis interactively" and get a full D3.js visualization with draggable molecules, real-time reactions, and gamified learning.

**I need you to search for:**

### 1. Technical Implementation Secrets
- How did Khan Academy's AI tutor Khanmigo actually get built? What's their tech stack?
- Are there any leaked system prompts from educational AI platforms like Socratic, Photomath, or Brainly?
- What open-source libraries exist for educational visualizations beyond D3.js?
- How are companies like Brilliant.org generating their interactive STEM lessons?
- What's the architecture behind Duolingo's AI-powered lesson generation?

### 2. Market Intelligence & Opportunities
- What educational AI startups got funded in 2024-2025? What's their secret sauce?
- Which subjects/topics have the highest demand but lowest supply of interactive content?
- What are teachers' biggest pain points with current educational tools in 2025?
- How much are schools/universities spending on interactive learning platforms?
- What failed EdTech startups can I learn from? Why did they fail?

### 3. Competitive Advantages & Moats
- How can I use WebContainers/Sandpack to give students instant coding environments?
- What's the latest in AI model fine-tuning for educational content (beyond Claude/GPT)?
- Are there any educational datasets or pre-trained models I can leverage?
- How are platforms handling COPPA/FERPA compliance for student data?
- What patents or IP exist around AI-generated educational content?

### 4. Technical Architecture Deep Dive
- Find actual code examples of:
  - AI generating D3.js visualizations
  - Educational prompt engineering templates
  - RAG systems for curriculum alignment
  - Multi-modal learning (text + visual + interactive)
- How to implement adaptive learning algorithms that adjust difficulty in real-time?
- Best practices for generating mathematically/scientifically accurate visualizations?

### 5. Monetization & Growth Hacks
- How did Photomath grow to 300M+ downloads? What was their growth strategy?
- What's the unit economics of B2B EdTech SaaS in 2025?
- How are platforms like Coursera using AI to reduce content creation costs?
- What's the LTV/CAC for educational platforms targeting K-12 vs higher ed?
- Any case studies of EdTech platforms that successfully pivoted?

### 6. Hidden Gems & Insider Knowledge
- Are there any university research papers on AI-generated educational content?
- What open-source projects are MIT/Stanford/CMU working on for education?
- Any Discord servers, Reddit communities, or forums where EdTech builders hang out?
- What APIs or services could I combine in unique ways (like Replicate + Observable + P5.js)?
- Who are the top engineers/researchers I should follow or try to recruit?

### 7. Rapid Prototyping Strategy
- What's the fastest way to validate this idea with real students/teachers?
- Should I start with browser-based (like Bolt) or native app approach?
- How can I leverage existing platforms (WordPress plugins, Chrome extensions, LMS integrations)?
- What no-code/low-code tools could accelerate my MVP development?
- Any grant programs or accelerators specifically for EdTech AI startups?

**Please search deeply and think creatively about non-obvious connections. Look for:**
- GitHub repos with <100 stars that solve similar problems
- Academic papers from 2024-2025 on interactive learning
- Patent filings from big tech companies in education
- Developer forums discussing educational visualization challenges
- Startup postmortems and pivot stories in EdTech

**Format your response with:**
1. Actionable insights I can implement immediately
2. Specific code examples or architectural patterns
3. Names of people, companies, or projects to investigate further
4. Potential partnerships or acquisition targets
5. Non-obvious market opportunities others are missing

Remember: I want to build something that makes Seeing-Theory look primitive in comparison, while being 100x easier to create content for. Think Khan Academy meets Figma meets GitHub Copilot for education.
