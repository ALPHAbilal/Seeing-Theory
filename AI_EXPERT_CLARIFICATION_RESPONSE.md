# Response to Expert AI's Clarifying Questions

## Crystal Clear Priorities for Maximum Value

### 1. Primary Focus Area: AI Orchestration Layer (70%) + Code Execution (30%)

**AI Orchestration is my #1 priority because:**
- This is the hardest part to figure out and replicate
- It's their main competitive advantage (anyone can integrate WebContainers)
- I specifically need:
  - **Model routing logic**: When/why they switch between Claude, GPT-4, custom models
  - **Prompt templates**: The exact structure that makes code generation reliable
  - **Context management**: How they maintain state across long conversations
  - **Error recovery**: How they detect and fix bad generations automatically

**Code Execution is secondary but important:**
- I can use existing solutions (WebContainers, Sandpack)
- But I need to know their specific optimizations
- Most interested in: security measures, performance tricks, cost optimizations

### 2. Implementation Timeline: Small Team (2-3 developers) with Seed Funding

**My situation:**
- Building with a technical co-founder + 1 engineer
- Have $50K personal investment + seeking $500K-1M seed
- Goal: MVP in 3 months, beta launch in 6 months
- Need architecture that can start simple but scale later

**This means I need:**
- Pragmatic solutions (not enterprise-scale immediately)
- Open-source foundations I can build upon
- Cost-effective approaches (can't afford thousands in GPU costs initially)
- Clear upgrade path as we grow

### 3. Technical Depth Preference: 80% Technical Implementation, 20% Strategic

**I need actual code and specifications because:**
- I'm a technical founder who will be coding this myself
- Marketing/strategy I can figure out - it's the technical "how" that's hard
- Specifically want:
  - Code snippets I can adapt
  - Architecture diagrams I can implement
  - Specific package versions and dependencies
  - Configuration examples
  - Performance benchmarks

**Strategic intelligence I care about:**
- Only technical strategy (not business model)
- What technical decisions they regret
- What they would build differently today
- Which approaches are evolutionary dead ends

## The Ultimate Question I Need Answered:

**"If I were to build a competitor to Cursor/Lovable starting TODAY, knowing everything they know NOW, what would be the optimal technical architecture that could be built by a small team in 3-6 months?"**

This means:
- Skip their legacy decisions and failed experiments
- Use the latest models and techniques (2025 state-of-art)
- Focus on what actually matters for users
- Build something 10x better, not just different

## Specific Technical Mysteries to Solve:

1. **The Context Window Problem**: How does Lovable handle 50+ turn conversations without degrading? Is it semantic compression? Sliding windows? Something else?

2. **The Speed Secret**: Cursor's tab completion is INSTANT. Are they running local models? Aggressive caching? Speculative execution?

3. **The Reliability Mystery**: v0 rarely generates broken code. What's their validation pipeline? Multiple model voting? AST checking?

4. **The Cost Paradox**: How does Cursor offer unlimited Claude at $20/month when API costs alone would be higher?

5. **The RAG Implementation**: Everyone talks about RAG but nobody shows the implementation. What are the actual chunking strategies, embedding models, and retrieval algorithms?

Please prioritize finding:
- GitHub repos (even partial implementations)
- Technical blog posts with code
- Conference talks with architecture details
- Patent filings with implementation specifics
- Open-source alternatives I can study
- Leaked internal documentation
- Engineer interviews discussing technical challenges

I'm building the "Seeing-Theory for Everything" - an AI platform that generates interactive educational content. But the architecture patterns from these code generation platforms are exactly what I need to understand first.

*In summary: I need the technical blueprint to build a focused, high-quality AI code generation system optimized for educational content, built by a small team, using 2025's best practices, not 2023's legacy decisions.*
